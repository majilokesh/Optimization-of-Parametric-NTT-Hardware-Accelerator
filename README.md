# Optimization-of-Parametric-NTT-Hardware-Accelerator
This project delves into the optimisation of the modular multiplication block of hardware implementation of Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) using FPGA and ASIC flow. The study explores four distinct multiplier designs: the conventional multiplier, the Karatsuba multiplier, the overlap-free Karatsuba multiplier, and the radix-4 Booth multiplier.

Using Cadence tools such as Genus and Innovus, along with the Cadence gpdk 45 nm technology, we implemented the NTT hardware. For synthesis in FPGA we used Xilinx Vivado and Zynq Zedboard [xc7z020clg484-1]. A comprehensive comparison was made based on power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics. The results demonstrate that out of all tested multiplier designs, the radix-4 Booth multiplier outshined the others in terms of area and power efficiency, making it an attractive choice for cost-effective and scalable implementations, especially for large-scale applications.

This research provides valuable insights into the hardware implementation of NTT. The findings serve as crucial guidance for researchers and hardware designers to select the most suitable multiplier architecture, optimizing performance for various NTT-based applications. Moreover, the study lays the groundwork for integrating these NTT designs into custom integrated circuits, enabling enhanced performance across diverse NTT applications.
